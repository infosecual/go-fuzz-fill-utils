# Test end-to-end fuzzing. This test focuses on return value reuse in fz.Chain.
# See github.com/infosecual/go-fuzz-fill-utils/examples/inputs/return-reuse for comments about target.
# Requires -end2end flag for 'go test'.
#
# Some test details:
#   1. We assume a 1.18 gotip is in the path. (We exit early if no gotip is in path,
#      or if it appears to be the wrong version).
#   2. To just run this script, execute from the go-fuzz-fill-utils directory:
#      go test -run=TestScripts/return_reuse_fuzzing -end2end
#   3. Adding '-v -testwork' shows more detail, including the temp dir location,
#      which will be left behind for inspection or manual debugging.
