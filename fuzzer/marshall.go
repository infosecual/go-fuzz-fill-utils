// unmarshalPlan consumes bytes to construct a Plan describing
// which calls we will fuzz, in what order, and how their
// arguments will be obtained (e.g., new value, re-used arg, re-used return val).
// It attempts to return plan.Calls that are fully covered by the input bytes
// in an effort to be friendlier to corpus evolution.
// If a call is included in the returned Plan, its argument sources
// are fully described by the bytes, though if an argument source in a plan.Call
// is a new argument, there might not be enough subsequent bytes to fully fill the argument
// value, which currently means it might be filled with the zero value for a basic type
// or have zero values for some elements if it is a composite type.
// This is hopefully reasonably friendly to the underlying fuzzing engine,
// including the coverage-guided evolution and tail trim minimization, which is currently
// the first minimization technique for both cmd/go and dvyukov/go-fuzz.
//
// It is the caller's responsibility to track how many bytes are consumed.
// E.g., caller could do:
//   buf := bytes.NewReader(data)
//   pl := unmarshalPlan(buf, ...)
//   used := len(data) - buf.Len()
